Make a rap with loops! Talk into your <b>mic</b> to make the loops.<br>
Tap anywhere on the canvas to <b>start</b>. The water surface shows the audio waveform, the bubbles show each track's spectrogram.<br>
Tap on any of the 4 <b>fish</b>, it will turn <span style="color:#fa0">orange</span> when selected. On the next loop, a <span style="color:#fff">white</span> waveform will appear from the sound of the mic, and the fish will eat the sound. From the next loop, the fish will play back the sound.<br>
Tap the area above the water (at the top of the canvas) to <b>stop</b> at the end of the loop. Double-tap to change track visualization.
<br><br>
<b>Microphone</b> required for recording.<br>
Due to lack of support for the MediaRecorder API, <b>recording will not work on iOS/Safari/Edge</b>. It works on Android/Chrome/Firefox.
